# levy-inverter

The `levy-inverter` is a tool that can quickly invert the pitches of a `midi` file based on a user-defined tonal center. This concept was first pioneered by twentieth century Musicologist [Ernst Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Levy) and explored in his book, *A Theory of Harmony*.
